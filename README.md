# Diabetes-Analyses

**Final Project for Statistical Data Processing**

This project analyzes risk factors and builds predictive models for diabetes using real-world data, as part of the final assignment for the Statistical Data Processing course.

## Global Diabetes Situation

Diabetes is rapidly increasing worldwide and poses a serious threat to public health. The number of people affected is expected to rise by over 50% from 415 million in 2015 to 642 million by 2040, especially in developing countries.

The chart above illustrates the projected growth in diabetes cases across different regions of the world. In response to this alarming trend, this project focuses on analyzing risk factors for diabetes through data, including the following sections:

- Overview and description of the dataset
- Data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization
- Hypothesis testing using AB Testing
- Addressing data imbalance and building predictive models
- Evaluating results and proposing solutions

These contents aim to support effective prediction, prevention, and management of diabetes.
